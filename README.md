# Chatbot Internship with PyTorch and RoBERTa

Welcome to the Chatbot Internship project repository! In this internship, we'll be working with PyTorch and the RoBERTa model to build an advanced chatbot capable of natural language understanding and generation. This project is designed to provide you with hands-on experience in deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and chatbot development. Whether you're new to these technologies or looking to expand your skills, this internship will provide a valuable learning experience.

## Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you should have the following prerequisites:

- Intermediate knowledge of Python programming.
- Basic understanding of deep learning concepts.
